# Math-Movies
Clean data about math movies from http://www.qedcat.com/moviemath/

I did not collect or write this data, I only formatted it into a CSV. I will not keep it up to date. I've also included the data formatted as HTML code, as it would appear in the qedcat website.

The `math stars` ranking is by qedcat and they describe it as:

> "To make browsing easier, we have included a star rating for mathness, in either fun or quality or quantity: from 5 for [must-see movies], down to 1 for minimal maths content."

The `IMDB` entry is the unique identifer that IMDB uses for that movie or show. You can go to the IMDB page for that movie or show by replacing the url `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/` with the corresponding IMDB number (include a `tt` to start).
