<a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/'>IMDB</a> Not the masterpiece people are declaring, but a polished and reasonably accurate movie about the blackwomen 'computers', in particular Katherine Johnson, who worked for NASA in the 50s and 60s. More a movie about racism than mathematics (just as <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> was a movie about schizophrenia),  but plenty of blackboards with orbital equations and (horrendous) numerical calculations.  The mathematics that is discussed is extensively simplified, phrased as the problem of the transition from an elliptical orbit to the 'parabolic' reentry. It's all more along the lines of relevant buzzwords than an accurate portrayal of the mechanics with which NASA had to come to terms.</p>

Evenin this state the flow will develop singularities in finite time. But, by using alocal version of the Gromov compactness theorem, I've been able to get a model of all possible singularities ...' This is actually real mathematics, underlying Perelman'sproof of the Poincar&eacute; conjecture.

Figuring the average is 4 marks a day and there are 300,000 of them, how much would the state save if these individuals were simply eliminated?' 'Completely unbelievable!' 'That is exactly how I reacted.' 'Completely unbelievable. I can't believe an elementary school child is expected to solve something like this. It's a difficult calculation, the proportions, the percentages, they need some algebra to solve these equations, right? That would be highschool material for us.' 'No, no, it's just multiplication, what did you say it was, 300,000 cripples?' 'Yes.' '300,000 times four. We'd be saving about 1,200,000 marks a day if we killed them all. It's easy.'

Gahagan has a mathematical scheme for bettingon the horses: 'I make my mind go blank until a number pops into it. Then I multiplythe number by the same number, and the last number of the result is the horseI plunk it on'. He uses his system to pick horse 7 (because 6 x 6 = 37), then 4 (4 x 4 = 14), then 9 (9 x 9  = 99), then 7 (7 x 7 = 47), then 8 (8 x 8 = 68). He wins. <a href='http://www.qedcat.com/movieclips/index.html'>Clip on our maths clips page</a>.</p>
